Project Name: MaxLevelSumBinaryTree

Description:
-------------
This project finds the level in a binary tree which has the maximum sum of node values.

- Level of root is 1.
- Level of children increases by 1 per depth.
- The program uses BFS (Breadth First Search) to traverse the tree level by level.
- It calculates the sum at each level and returns the level with the maximum sum.

Features:
----------
1. Supports positive and negative integers in tree nodes.
2. BFS ensures level-wise traversal.
3. Easy to understand and HR-friendly.
4. Handles large trees efficiently (up to 10^4 nodes).



Example:
---------
Tree:
        1
       / \
      7   0
     / \
    7  -8

Code in Main.java:
------------------
TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.right = new TreeNode(0);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(-8);

Solution solution = new Solution();
int result = solution.maxLevelSum(root);
System.out.println("Level with maximum sum: " + result);

Output:
--------
Level with maximum sum: 2

Time Complexity:
----------------
O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space Complexity:
-----------------
O(n), due to the queue used in BFS.

Notes:
------
- Uses Queue for BFS.
- If multiple levels have same sum, returns the first (topmost) level.
- Suitable for HR and technical interviews.
